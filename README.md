Exercise 1:
# Instructions

Use React and the `profiles`, `users`, and `movies` data in `App.js` to display a list of users alongside their favorite movies.

From this information, one of the list items might look like this:

> Jane Cruz's favorite movie is Planet Earth 1.

Exercise 2:
For each movie in the list, there are two options:

1. If the movie has been favorited, then display a list of all of the users who said that this movie was their favorite.
2. If the movie has *not* been favorited, display some text stating that no one favorited the movie.
